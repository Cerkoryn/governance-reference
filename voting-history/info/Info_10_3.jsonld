    "comment": "Due to the failure of the 200M Net Change Limit proposal, I am switching my vote to YES for the 300M ADA limit. The 300M cap replaces the existing 350M cap with a noticeably tighter ceiling while still covering every budget item that cleared the 50% off-chain vote.  Several of those items are unlikely to also secure the 67% withdrawal vote, meaning that real spending is expected to be comfortably below 300M ADA. Furthermore, ADAâ€™s market price has risen roughly 50% since those budgets were priced, making further restraint both feasible and prudent. This compromise keeps spending within expected inflows, preserves continuity for approved projects, and moves us toward more conservative treasury management until the governance framework matures."
