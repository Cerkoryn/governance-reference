    "comment": "I support the principle of deploying some treasury funds to deepen stablecoin liquidity on Cardano, but for a first-time request of this nature, the 50M ADA ask plus relatively high management stipends feels a bit oversized. I would prefer a smaller pilot to validate the model and trim administrative costs. In addition, naming a seven-person multisig exposes those individuals to heightened physical-security and cyber-risk that is difficult to mitigate.  It is also worth noting that due to tooling errors, this proposal will likely be re-submitted in the future.   For these reasons I will vote ABSTAIN and look for a leaner, better-protected iteration when it is re-proposed in the future."
