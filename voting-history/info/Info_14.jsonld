    "comment": "This was a tough vote for me.  Initially I was inclined to vote NO due to the steep asking price and the history of UX issues.  After some more thought, I started to lean toward ABSTAIN because the UX issues have improved substantially and because GovTools happens to be one of few open-source governance platforms on Cardano.  I also think that GovTools having a budget of its own is overkill and that it would be better suited as part of another budget such the OSC's (Open Source Committee).  But after reading through the longer, detailed version of the proposal linked at the end, I've come to understand a few more key features that may justify the higher price tag.\n\nIn particular, the integration with CoSponsor to develop a smart contract solution to crowdsource governance action deposits is sorely needed.  That development on its own is likely to require a substantial amount of effort beyond developing and maintaining the GovTools site.  Other features like performing multiple votes in a single transaction and improvements to the proposal discussion section are also in the works.\n\nGiven these additional considerations, I am casting a vote of YES on this info action on the condition that the features proposed are delivered adequately, and that any future asks from the Cardano treasury are significantly smaller in scope.
