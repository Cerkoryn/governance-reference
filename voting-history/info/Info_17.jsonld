    "comment": "This document in general feels too broad, but in some places, oddly over-specific.  For example, trying to list every category of person/entity who Cardano was built for will inevitably leave someone or something out. I like that it includes KPIs, but there’s no clear ownership or accountability.  Who is responsible for each KPI?  How are results reviewed? What happens if targets aren’t met? Several pillars also read as duplicates. Points 1 and 4 are largely “adoption,” while points 2 and 3 are about “engagement,” which feels like mostly bloat. The governance action mentions defining the \"Vision and Strategy\", but the document seems to only mention the Strategy.\n\nI'm not sure if this fits in the Strategy section or the Vision section, but personally what I would like to see is a continuation of the vision Cardano started with its initial roadmap. We had the Byron \"Foundation\" Era, the Shelley \"Decentralization\" Era, the Goguen \"Smart Contract\" Era, the Basho \"Scaling\" Era, and the Voltaire \"Governance\" Era. I think extending the roadmap to future Eras, each around a singular goal, will unite the community to accomplish those goals. It is clear to me that \"Adoption\" should be one of those eras (Gutenberg Era?). Some other ideas could be composability, modularity, interoperability, privacy, sustainability, quantum resistance, etc.  I’m voting NO on this proposal because it is clear that further refinement is needed before it can be considered sufficient and complete."
