    "comment": "This budget covers many of the integrations the Cardano community has been asking for for a long time.  Perhaps even more exciting though is that this is a joint effort that will have us see all the founding entities of Cardano working together.\n\nMy understanding is that the 70M price tag is well below the actual cost of these integrations, and the entities themselves will be covering the difference.  To me this seems like a no-brainer.\n\nHowever, my primary concern that needs to be stated is what this will mean for our native, homegrown stablecoin and Oracle teams:  Moneta's USDM, Anzens' USDA, Charli3, and OrcFax.  My worry is that subsidizing outsider tier-1 stablecoins and Oracle solutions will cause unfortunate side-effects to the businesses of these loyal Cardano teams.  I will be voting YES on this proposal, but my only ask is that we consider these Cardano-native teams when brokering any deals with other tier-1 stablecoins and Oracles."
