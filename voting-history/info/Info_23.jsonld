    "comment": "As a dRep deeply invested in Cardano's long-term success, I've reviewed the updated Vision and Strategy drafts alongside the governance action proposing their adoption. While I appreciate the ambition to outline a path toward success for Cardano, these documents fall short of being actionable or unifying. They also feel too broad such that it will be difficult to get everyone on the same page or hold anyone accountable for meeting the stated KPIs.\n\nBoth the Vision and the Strategy give off the impression that, \"We're gonna do absolutely everything really well\" but with little guidance on how exactly we are going to do that.  The KPIs are great aspirations but we have little direct control over them.  I propose using Measures-of-Performance (MoP) for how well we perform those things we do have direct control over.  Similarly, we can use Measures-of-Effectiveness (MoE) to see if the things we actually did resulted in the effects that we want to see.  From there I think it would be better to identify the most high-impact items and either focus on them one pillar at a time or in structured Eras like we did with the previous Cardano roadmap.\n\nFinally, I think that if we want to live up to the stated vision of being the \"most secure, reliable and censorship-resistant blockchain\" then we need to have the moral courage and the political will to adjust certain incentives and parameter settings that have been stale for many years.  The language in the SPO Incentives section about keeping the pool distribution where it is implies that the status quo is sufficient.  But it is my strong belief that there is much improvement to be made there.\n\nFor these reasons I think that the Vision and Strategy documents still need some more work and am voting NO on this proposal."
