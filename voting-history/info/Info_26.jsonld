    "comment": "After careful consideration I have chosen to vote NO on this NCL of 350M ADA for 100 epochs (505 days).  While I appreciate that the lengthened timeline and the normalized reduction of about 27.72% from the previous NCL, I still think it is a bit too much for the Cardano ecosystem's current position.  The reserve is dwindling and emissions have decreased since last year, the price of ADA currently at $0.33 gives us very little leverage against actual costs measured in USD, and the 2030 Vision/Strategy is not quite refined enough that I feel comfortable spending 350M ADA without a more promising ROI.  For these reasons I am voting NO on this proposal."
