    "comment": "I am voting yes on the Info Action proposal to define the Cardano Vision and Roadmap for 2025 and beyond. I believe the proposed roadmap covers the majority of essential improvements and technologies necessary to advance Cardano.\n\nHowever, there are additional items I would like to see considered, including bootstrapping P2P-DeFi, seeding stablecoin liquidity from the treasury, and further enhancements to SPO incentives. I have submitted issues and a pull request on GitHub proposing the inclusion of some of these items in the roadmap.\n\nAdditionally, I note that the metadata attached to this proposal is not immutable, as it ideally should be. Nevertheless, since this is an Info Action and does not alter the ledger state, it does not affect the outcome of my vote.\n\nFor transparency and accountability, I include the SHA-256 hash of the raw text found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IntersectMBO/product-website/refs/heads/master/src/pages/vision-roadmap-2025.mdx at the time of this vote: 72ac255dba0114b51d54d384016e0042e3a3ccab1648fa839e313ac5cfa007cc"
