    "comment": "I’m voting YES on the 200M ADA NCL because it is a fiscally responsible midpoint. It preserves-or-grows the Treasury instead of matching last year’s 350M inflow, yet it doesn’t delay the current budget cycle because the already-enacted 350M limit keeps the budget process open while this refinement is adopted. By shrinking the pot to 200M, proposers must sharpen their forecasts and compete harder, curbing inflated asks and driving better value. Most importantly, a tighter cap protects the protocol while on-chain governance, auditing, and budgeting mechanisms are still in their infancy, ensuring we learn and iterate under controlled risk rather than spending aggressively before the guardrails are battle-tested."
