    "comment": "The budget for this proposal was already approved prior to the Constitution changing that no longer requires it.  It is unfortunate that this governance action will likely be deemed unconstitutional due to this technicality and the expiration of the NCL.  However, I still believe that using some treasury funds to subsidize DeFi stablecoin liquidity will be a huge boon to the Cardano ecosystem.  I am especially glad to see that the smart contract development costs have shrank since the original budget due to some volunteer work by community devs, even though legal costs have increased slightly and the USD valuation of ADA has dropped.  One other piece of feedback I'd like to leave is that I think technically the smart contract should be called a Pragma Contract instead of Amaru Contract, since the latter refers to node software.  I hope to see this proposal make it through a future withdrawal in the near future."
