    "comment": "After having participated in numerous Cardano Constitution discussions and reading various different drafts, as well as analyzing the current concerns about proposal & discussion availability on GovTools, I have decided to vote yes on the delegate-approved Constitution.  I still think that the Constitution and the platforms/tools that inform delegators need some work, but this draft is still a major step up from the Interim Constitution that is in place.  It is also worth noting that the Interim Constitution might REQUIRE this delegate-approved draft to be in place before other drafts can be proposed.  For these reasons, I am voting yes."
