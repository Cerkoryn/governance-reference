    "comment": "I’m voting YES on Constitution v2.3 because it is more clear and concise, which is a step in the right direction. Removing the Budget Info Action requirement will streamline treasury withdrawals and mitigate redundant voting.  Removing codes of conduct is also an improvement because that is not something that is enforceable by the Constitutional Committee.\n\nThat said, there are still more improvements to be desired and unenforceable rules that should be removed.  In my opinion one of the most troublesome sections are the CRITICAL & SECURITY parameter categories in the guardrails. Article II Section 5 tells SPOs to vote on “security-relevant” parameter updates, but these parameters are called \"CRITICAL parameters\" and listed in Section 2.1 of the guardrails.  Even more confusingly, Section 2.4 has a different category called \"Technical/Security Parameters\", but these are different from the CRITICAL parameters or the \"security-relevant\" parameters mention in Article II Section 5. This confusing categorization desperately needs to be clarified in a future revision of the Constitution.  However, since this iteration is an improvement over the current constitution I will be voting YES on this proposal."
